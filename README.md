### Hi there hello, it's me, Ocawesome101

i am a hobbyist programmer (mostly lua, but some C and others).  [Recrafted](https://ocawesome101.github.io/recrafted) is pretty cool.

i wrote a [soft-body physics engine](https://github.com/ocawesome101/pine-jam-2023) in a week for a game jam.  i didn't win but it was fun.

i'm good enough at piano [and sometimes i compose things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2fW_Gae4kQ).
